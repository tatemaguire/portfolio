    I'm thinking of having an AWESOME button that makes the page awesome.
    It would have to switch between two completely separate sites honestly.
    This is cause I want my awesome site to be a game in itself.
    Like maybe you explore a map full of my projects.
    And when you switch to awesome mode, a fullscreen explosion effect.

    The button should rest on the top of the website at all times, so you can easily
    switch back at any time. 

    I also have this idea to have a score that is kept in your cookies data. It could be directly
    influenced by your score inside my games, and also in the metagame.
    But that would be hard to implement, getting the score from each project I've made.


    AWESOME mode should still be my portfolio. You should be able to navigate to each of my
    projects
