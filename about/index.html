          I am a third year student at UC Santa Cruz, and I'm pursuing a B.S. in 
          Computer Science: Game Design, and a Minor in Electronic Music. I have experience 
          programming in C#, C++, JavaScript, Java, Lua, & Python. I'm also experienced in 
          software engineering, technical systems design, game programming, and sound design. 
          I am actively building games in Unity/Godot and experimenting with advanced graphical 
          algorithms.
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm currently looking for an internship for Summer 2026 as a software engineer,
          game designer, or sound designer.

          Tiny Renderer is a 3D rendering API that I implemented in C++. I used Bresenham's 
          line algorithm and Barycentric coordinates to draw lines and triangles on screen 
          with UV texture mapping and flat shading. I also designed and implemented a Matrix 
          class to use for calculating perspective projection.

          Pink Yellow Swaparoni is a 2D metroidvania/platformer I made that started as a 
          school project but quickly turned into a passion project. I designed it, 
          programmed movement mechanics and particles, and synthesized sound effects. To make 
          level editing easier, I created a special tilemap parser to separate the tilemap into
          parallel pink and yellow worlds.

          Ghost is a puzzle game I made for the week-long Uni Game Jam 2025. I made it using 
          Pico-8, a fantasy retro console with strict limitations. I made a custom particle 
          system that reacts to player movement in unique ways.
