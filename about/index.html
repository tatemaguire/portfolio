        <p>
          I am a third year student at UC Santa Cruz, and I'm pursuing a B.S. in 
          Computer Science: Game Design, and a Minor in Electronic Music. I have experience 
          programming in C#, C++, JavaScript, Java, Lua, & Python. I'm also experienced in 
          software engineering, technical systems design, game programming, and sound design. 
          I am actively building games in Unity/Godot and experimenting with advanced graphical 
          algorithms.
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm currently looking for an internship for Summer 2026 as a software engineer,
          game designer, or sound designer.

        <p>
          Tiny Renderer is a 3D rendering API that I implemented in C++. I used Bresenham's 
          line algorithm and Barycentric coordinates to draw lines and triangles on screen 
          with UV texture mapping and flat shading. I also designed and implemented a Matrix 
          class to use for calculating perspective projection.
